Oinka oinka oinka why you awake.
I'm a realist and a dreamer.
I believe you only get to be in real love once.
I don't care what people think about me. Never did, never will. Life is too short to be worrying about that shit.
You are the only person who can sort yourself out, you can't rely on other people to sort out your problems.
Life is so much more rewarding if you strive for something, rather than take what's given to you on a plate.
When you get your heart broken you can't help but believe that only that person can put it back together again.
I don't like to look back and think 'That was a horrible time'. I prefer to think 'I'm glad I came through that'.
There are certain things you can give certain people and certain things you can't.
When you have had your heart broken once, it can never be broken again.
If you can't sort something out for yourself, then no one can help you.
There are worse things in life to worry about than bad press.
Life is funny and sad, sometimes both at the same time.
I'm not a very 'poor me' kind of person. I wouldn't want it to be all roses because life isn't like that.
If you split up with someone twice, there's usually a good reason why you shouldn't be together.
When we hurt, we all make things seem a certain way, or make things look worse than they are.
Life happens. There's no point in being upset or down about things we can't control or change.
Life is short and I have made a lot of mistakes, but everything in life happens for a reason.
The minute I even start to think about what I'm doing I just lose it. I have to just shut my eyes and flow.
If you don't throw yourself into something, you'll never know what you could have had.
